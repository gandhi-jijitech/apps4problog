### **Welcome to Apps4Pro’s Planner Manager App**:

*Apps4Pro’s Planner Manager* app is **innovated on top of Microsoft
Planner.**

-   ***Planner Manager offers a lot of innovative features that aren’t
    available in Microsoft Planner; the “Copy” feature is just one of
    many.***
-   ***Microsoft Office 365’s Planner app is Great**, yet it still
    preaches the famous philosophy “**Without imperfection nothing
    exists**”. The shortcoming is; with Planner app you could not create
    a Copy of Plan/Tasks within the same Office 365 Group or a Plan.*

**With “Planner Manager” you can now Copy Plan/Tasks - either within the
same Office 365 Group in Planner (OR) within the same team in Microsoft
Teams. Period.**

-   Have you ever thought about “**What’s the most used invention in
    Software?**”. Probably the award goes to; the brilliant feature of
    “**Copy and Paste”. It made work possible without re-work.**
-   “**Our Planner Manager App Copies(Export) and truly it isn’t a
    copy**”.

### **An invite with the Moving Images of “Copy” feature**:

### **How Planner Manager’s Copy Feature exceeds your expectations?**

1.  **Updates Microsoft Planner App:** 
    Planner Manager app is directly connected to Microsoft Planner at
    the backend; so, whatever you do with our app & data is
    automatically reflected in your Microsoft Planner app also. Isn’t
    this prodigious, pal?

2.  **How to copy a Plan/Tasks within the same team in Microsoft
    Teams?**
    The genius of our Planner Manager can be seen when you have a
    Microsoft Planner Tab in Microsoft Teams app. Indeed, only with
    Apps4Pro’s Planner Manager you can now copy(Export/Edit) a
    Plan/Tasks within the same Team(Office 365 Group) in Microsoft
    Teams. Isn’t this what you were looking for, pal?

3.  **Copy within same Office 365 Group**:
    A gentle reminder, pal. With Planner Manager (not with MS.Planner)
    you can now create new plan/tasks within the “same” Office 365 Group
    or a Plan.
