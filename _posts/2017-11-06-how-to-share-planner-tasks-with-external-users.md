Hello,

This is the second blog in this series which describes the new features
coming to Apps4.Pro Planner Manager. Our [last
blog](http://www.jijitechnologies.com/blogs/how-to-create-and-use-office-365-planner-task-plan-template)
details you how to create a Plan / Task template for Planner tasks using
Apps4.Pro Planner Manager. We are happy to see your responses in
[Apps4.Pro Yammer network](https://www.yammer.com/apps4pro) for this
feature and glad that we help you in save time and increase
productivity.

In this blog I will detail you how to share Gantt chart with anonymous
users. We have received enormous feedback from users and understand that
you need to share Gantt with other users who is not a member in your
team in following cases.

-   Share task progress for project with your customers / clients
-   Share progress with management during review meetings
-   During project planning and implementation

These are few cases were you need to share your Plan and tasks with
anonymous users. Apps4.Pro Planner Manager allows you to share the Gantt
chart with anonymous users in a click. The anonymous users can able to
view the Gantt and download task attachments but cannot perform any
actions on it. Trello offers the similar feature as 'Observers' for a
board. But using Apps4.Pro Planner Manager you can even combine tasks
across multiple plans to generate Gantt and share with anonymous users.

> TIP : Planner Manager allows you to filter, Group By, Sort tasks across
multiple plans and generate Gantt chart. Thus you don’t need to generate
it separately for each plan if your team members span across multiple
plans.

Now let's see how it works. From Apps4.Pro Planner Manager, users can
generate the report they need and apply Filters or Group By. Once done,
click on Share Gantt button as shown in below image.

Now a popup will ask you to enter your Office 365 username and password.
Enter it and click on Share button. This will create json file which
includes the task details you have shared and it will be uploaded in to
your OneDrive.

Once upload is completed a shared link will be available. You can share
this link to anonymous users and they can view and download attachments
from tasks.

When the anonymous user opens the link in browser the Gantt chart as
shown in below image will be available for them in read only mode. From
the same link, the users can view the tasks in Gantt chart / Scheduler
view.
