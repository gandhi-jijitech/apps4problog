We are excited to announce the new feature **Archive Plan for Microsoft
Planner** in our product [Apps4Pro Planner
Manager](https://apps4.pro/planner-manager.aspx). Maintaining old or
completed project details is an important task for future reference or
for compliance. Microsoft Planner does not offer the way archive
completed plans. We have been receiving requests from our users to
implement this feature in Planner Manager app for a long time and we did
it now.

Apps4.Pro Planner introduce this new solution as a Pro feature of
Planner Manager app. Archiving the plan enables you to save the plan,
tasks, task details, attachments, checklists everything stored in a
SharePoint list in the plan’s associated Office 365 group. Once the plan
is archived, you can delete the plan from Planner portal, and you can
view the archived plan and their tasks in read-only mode.

3.  Once you confirmed the required tasks are archived successfully, if
    needed, you can delete the plan from Planner.

associated Office 365 group, so you should not delete the plan’s
associated group at any cost. You will lose the archived plan details if
you have deleted the group.
