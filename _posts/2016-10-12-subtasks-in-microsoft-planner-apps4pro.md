Thanks for all your support in this great journey of Apps4.Pro Planner.

available in Microsoft Planner but was requested by many users. One such
exiting feature is **Subtasks**. We understand the need and use of
Subtasks and implementing it in your favourite app **Apps4.Pro
Planner**.

From Apps4.Pro Planner app you can able to Create, Edit, Add assignment,
Comment on Subtasks. When you create a new task from the app you will
