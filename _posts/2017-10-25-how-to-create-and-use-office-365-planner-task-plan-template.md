Microsoft Planner is widely used to manage projects for small teams.
Many of these projects comprise of recurring plans / tasks. This creates
the need for the team to use the set of tasks to create new plan or
import them to existing plan. It is a burden for the manager to create
new plan with same set of tasks again and again. Apps4.Pro Planner
Manager offers the feature to save the set of tasks from any existing
Plan in your Planner as a template. This template can be then used when
creating a new Plan or import to the existing plan.

 When you use this saved template to create a new Plan it is called as
Plan Template and when the template imported to existing Plan it is
called as Task Template.

#### How to create a new Plan / Task Template? 

It is very simple to create a new template with the tasks that spread
over different plans. From Apps4.Pro Planner Manager generate the report
you need and select the tasks from the list and click on Create Template
from Actions menu and enter the name for the template and save it. Now
the selected tasks will be saved along with its details such as Bucket,
Assigned to, Start / Due date. You can also modify this template by
including the tasks to the existing template anytime.

The below screenshot explains you the process of creating a new
template.

#### How to use the template to create new Plan (Plan Template)? 

From Apps4.Pro Planner Manager, navigate to All Plans report and from
Action menu select New Plan. This wizard helps you to create new plan
and import the template we have saved in the previous step. Now enter
the name of the Plan and select the template to be applied. That's it.
The new Plan will be created along with the buckets and tasks.
