#### Manage Plans 

Set the plans from which you need to fetch the tasks (For ex: your
favourite plans). So the app will sync the tasks from these plans alone.
You can find this option under Settings menu.

### Other Improvements 

-   During Excel import process you can include the Plan ID as a new
    column in Excel so the tasks will be Imported to that plan.
-   While Importing Tasks you will see the detailed status message for
    each step performed by the app. This helps you to know what's
    happening in the back end.
