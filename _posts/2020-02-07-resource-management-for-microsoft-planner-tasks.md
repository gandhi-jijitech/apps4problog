There can be a lot of innovative and productive features added to

for modern teams to **plan and manage** the **projects and its tasks**
effortlessly.

Introducing **Apps4.Pro Planner Gantt (Pro)** app - Adding innovation to

Apps4.Pro Planner Gantt (Pro) - **Feature Demo** - Let us now see how it
works:

#### **Resource Availability**

Managing your **resources** in the most efficient way is an art. Here
the word ‘resources’ speaks of **‘Human Resources’.** Managing the
available resources across different plans can be a pain in the Planner
environment. Our **latest update** to the Gantt app makes it easier to
manage the resources. This feature gives you a complete view of all your
**resources in one location.** This way, you can quickly assign the
**right member for the right task** and check if any resources are over
assigned with tasks. For example, you can easily view the number of
tasks assigned to all the individuals on a particular date and therefore
task assigning can be even improvised.

#### **What does Resource Availability offer you?**

-   You can have **absolute visibility** of all the **resources** and
    their tasks
-   Appoint the **right person onto the right task**
-   Map individual utilization levels and optimize them
-   Forecast upcoming demands, in terms of the capacity needed.
