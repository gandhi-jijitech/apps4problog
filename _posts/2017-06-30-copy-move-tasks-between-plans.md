Currently in Planner you can able to Copy / Move tasks between Buckets
in a Plan. This is the big limitation for users who gets tasks that
spreads over Plans. Example: During Employee onboarding process the task
needs to be moved between plans starting from HR Team to IT and
Accounts. During this process when a team completes the task it needs to
be moved to another Plan for assignment. With the current Planner design
you need to create tasks in each plan and assign it. This is really time
consuming and cumbersome for users to manage as they need to depend on
tasks from other plans.

Apps4.Pro Planner Manager gives you the ability to Copy / Move tasks
between plans including its attachments and conversations. All you need
to do is to select the tasks that needs to be moved to another plan and
hit action button and click Copy / Move tasks and select the target Plan
and Bucket. Donâ€™t forget to check 'Include attachments' and 'Include
conversations' boxes if you want to migrate those to different plan.
