What is Apps4.Pro Tasks?

Apps4.Pro Tasks is a simple add-in which acts as a central hub to manage
all your tasks from different task management systems (SharePoint,
Planner, Project, Outlook, Trello ). You donâ€™t have to worry about the
system which manages the Plan/project in which you are working on. It
will simply show you the respective user interface according to the
context. You can access this add-in via Web, OWA and Outlook clients in
Windows and Mac.

What it will do?

You can perform the following actions from Apps4.Pro Tasks irrespective
of the system the task lives in.

How it works?

it for simpler and effective management. You can able to Update or
assign tasks to users from here and it will be synced back to the
