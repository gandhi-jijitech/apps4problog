In some instances, the Teams and its channel needs to migrate from One
Office 365 Group to another. It can be in the same tenant or another
tenant. Some cases are:

it combines all users in your organization to chat, video calls, file
storage, and other Office 365 app integration in one place. Microsoft
Teams is the widely accepted and adopted tool for enterprises using
Office 365.

“Move Teams and its Channels for information flow between different
departments. “

In the case of company **mergers or acquisitions**.

**In Case 1** – the migration of Teams is between the **same tenant but to different Office 365 Group.**

**In Case 2** – the migration is **between 2 different Office 365 tenants.**

*Apps4.Pro Teams Migrator* is the pioneer and real migration app for
**Microsoft Teams**, which handles both these cases. This app migrates
not only the **Chat, Posts, and Files** but also migrates **Microsoft
Planner, OneNote, and Wiki data** as well. Hence **Apps4.Pro** serves as
the complete migration app.

**Apps4.Pro Team Migrator** is available as a browser extension in the
**Microsoft Edge addons store**. You can add it from the store to your
Edge browser and configure it for migration.

**Now let us jump in and see how it works** - It works in just **three**
simple steps.

#### **Step 1:**

Create new jobs in the app for migration. A job is nothing but the set
of configurations to **save** and **run at any time**.

#### **Step2: User Mapping**

The app will map the users in **source** and **target** tenants by
itself.

#### **Step3: Target Tenant Settings**

In this step you can decide to create new Office 365 group for your team
or can use existing *available Group to migrate the Team in the target
tenant*. Now you can Save this job or start the migration.

makes the migration of the Microsoft Teams to another tenant tedious.

process simple.
