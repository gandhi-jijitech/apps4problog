Microsoft rolled out below two new features in Office 365 Planner this
month.

-   Scheduled View
-   Filters

#### Scheduled View 

Earlier we had Board and Charts view of the task, now Schedule view is
available. With this you can

-   View all the tasks in a plan in calendar
-   Assign start and due for the tasks from the calendar by simply
    dropping the tasks from bucket
-   Edit the start and due for the tasks by dragging the task in the
    calendar

-   Label
-   Assignment
