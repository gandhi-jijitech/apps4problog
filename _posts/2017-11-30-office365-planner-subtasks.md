##### Hi all,

This blog is the third blog in this series which details the new
features coming to [Apps4.Pro Planner
Manager](http://apps4.pro/planner-manager.aspx). First blog details [how
to create and use Plan / task
template](http://www.jijitechnologies.com/blogs/how-to-create-and-use-office-365-planner-task-plan-template)
and the last blog details[how to share Planner tasks with external
users](http://www.jijitechnologies.com/blogs/how-to-share-planner-tasks-with-external-users).

In this blog I will detail you how to create sub tasks for existing
Planner tasks and view the sub tasks in Grid view and Gantt chart for
task planning.

### How to create Sub tasks from Planner Manager? 

Creating sub task for existing task is easy when Planner Manager is
used.

-   Double click on the existing task to get it opened in the edit
    window.
-   Type the sub tasks title in checklist items as shown in below image
    and click on **Promote checklist item as sub task**.
-   Now a new task will be created in Planner and linked with this
    parent task. This will help you to set due date, add assignment and
    post comments for the sub task.
-   A link will be created between Parent and Sub task. So whenever the
    user opens a task, its sub tasks will be listed and can be updated
    easily.

**Please note** that when you create a new task from Planner Manager
**Promote checklist item as sub task** button will not be available.
First you need to create new task and edit it to promote the checklist
items as sub tasks.

on it the user can easily navigate to its Parent task.

Below are the properties related to Sub tasks in Planner Manager.

**Parent Task** - This property lists the parent task title for a sub
task. It will be useful to GroupBy tasks based on this entity as it
groups tasks and its sub tasks hierarchal order.
