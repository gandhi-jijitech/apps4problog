There are situations in which you may need to work on multiple systems
for managing tasks. Take the case of the consultant, each organization
will use different systems as Planner, SharePoint Tasks, Outlook tasks,
Project Online, Wunderlist or Trello to manage their tasks. Consultant
has to switch different systems for working on those tasks which might
be complex. Similar case may also happen within a company where a
manager works with different teams using different solutions.

All of these causes fragmentation of tracking tasks in different
software causes disorganization and incomplete visibility of the
progress. This has been spoken by users for years to have a central
location to view / manage tasks irrespective of any system.
