Hello Everyone, 

 We are happy to announce the next update for [Apps4.Pro Power BI
Connector for Microsoft
Planner](https://apps4.pro/powerbi-reporting-for-microsoft-planner.aspx)
. We are introducing some cool new features with this release.

-   Sync custom fields created from Apps4.Pro Planner Manager
-   In-depth meta details for Plans and Tasks

#### Sync custom fields 

Apps4.Pro Power BI Connector for Microsoft Planner gives the ability to
sync Custom fields created from [Apps4.Pro Planner
Manager](https://apps4.pro/add-custom-fields-to-planner-task.aspx)
into the Power BI dashboard. Apps4.Pro Planner Manager allows users to
create new custom fields for Planner tasks. For example, a courier
company needs to add Consignee Address, Delivery Date and customer
rating to work. By Planner Manager, we can achieve this, and in Power
BI, we visualize the Consignee address in map view, and we can filter
out the resource performance based on customer rating

The **\*** symbol in the dataset table represents the custom fields.
