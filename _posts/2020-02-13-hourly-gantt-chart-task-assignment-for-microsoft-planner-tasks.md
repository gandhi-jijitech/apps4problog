The tedious part of the Gantt chart is to view the **Particular user
workflow** and assigning tasks to the users to the user& its
**completion**. Here comes a most awaiting feature called **"Hourly
Estimation"** makes this case simpler than anything.

This reflection has already been done in our application **– Apps4. Pro
Planner Gantt Pro.** 
[(https://apps4.pro/office365-planner-addin-gantt-chart.aspx)](https://apps4.pro/office365-planner-addin-gantt-chart.aspx)

### **The main scope of the feature:**

-   **Estimate Hours to be spent** for each task with its Duration to
    complete.
-   **Reduce the overload** of the user by equally sharing with other
    employees.
-   **Review** the task assignments and its status.
-   Work allocation **sequentially** with the team workflow
-   Clarity for the users in their **workflow & end result** assumption.

### **Reporting View:**

The reports ultimately show the specific users progress on a particular
task and allocated durations.

It needs us to set three main criteria:

1.  How many hours the user needs to spend on each task?
2.  **Assign / Unassign** tasks-based availability
3.  Automatic Schedule of **Timing allocation** based on the duration
    and Estimated hours based on the duration and Estimated hours to
    spent.

The calculated reports will be having the following piece of information

   ▶ View the end result as a **report in excel format**
   
   ▶ **Segregated view** of particular plans and it’s tasks
   
   ▶ **Hours assigned** for each user in a project or multiple projects
    together
    
   ▶ Tasks assigned for each user in a project or multiple projects
    together.
    
   ▶ Compare Baseline dates with Actual dates for each task visually in
    Gantt.
    
   ▶ Create an exact **project timeline**
   
   ▶ Milestones view all your project at once to align it with your
    deadlines.

By selecting hours per day in the **resource availability tab**,the
manager can easily find the total number of hours tasks are assigned for
each users.
