Tasks lay idle when not shared. When it comes to managing tasks it
become obvious that tasks needs to be shared with sub-contractors,
partners and customers. Trello offers the same as Observers. Plan
manager can add Observers to their board which in turn allows them to
contribute in the board. This is one of the major reason users decide to
go with Trello. Microsoft Planner haven't yet offered this feature and
it was one of the most requested in Office 365 Planner User voice
Portal. With Apps4.Pro Planner you can easily achieve this. This blog
