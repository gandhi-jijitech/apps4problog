Planner”*  and it’s a requested feature for **Microsoft Office
365 Planner** users. Apps4.Pro’s **Planner Manager app** is available in
the **Edge and Chrome web** stores as an **Extension**. You can

Planner.**  

Many of these projects comprise of recurring buckets. This creates the
need for the team to use the set of tasks to create a new plan. It is a
burden for the manager to create a new plan with the same set of buckets
again and again. **Apps4.Pro Planner Manager** offers the feature to
save the set buckets from any existing Plan in your Planner as a
template. This template can be used when creating a new Plan or import
to the existing plan.  Creating a template is a one-time action. Once
created, you can re-use it any number of times to create bucket
templates in the Planner. Thus, it helps you to save time.

**Now let’s jump in and see how it works.**

plans in the group you are a member of. You can filter the tasks by the
