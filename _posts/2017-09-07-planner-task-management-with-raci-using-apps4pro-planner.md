#### Custom Fields 

 Ability to create Custom Fields in Microsoft Planner is the most
requested feature by many users as it helps them to plan, deliver and
monitor the tasks assigned to users easily and efficiently. Experts
suggests different concepts to manage the tasks efficiently. Almost all
experts say the task details in a project should be crystal clear to all
users so they understand very well what their responsibility is and they
better perform. One such popular model is RACI Matrix, which helps users
to easily identify roles and responsibilities of them in the project.

In order to implement RACI Matrix, we need to create different custom
fields in task cards. This may vary from Plan to Plan. With the help of
Apps4.Pro Planner Manager organizations / teams can easily implement
RACI matrix in their projects and reap the benefit of simplicity in
Microsoft Planner without spending time for training and implementation.
As RACI model suggests each task should have the following details in
place.

-   **R**esponsible person for the task
-   **A**ccountable person for the task
-   **C**onsulted person for the task (Who is the subject matter expert)
-   **I**nformed to the person who is affected by the outcome of the
    task.

The Planner Manager consists of a list for the different field sets
which can be added with the tasks.

-   Single / Multi line (Ex: Notes for approver)
-   Date (Ex: Project deadline)
-   Number (Ex: Hours spent for this task)
